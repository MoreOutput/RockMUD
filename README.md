RockMUD
===============================

**RockMUD (0.2.0) is a Node powered WebSockets MUD server**

Try the latest on this Heroku hobby instance: http://rockmud.heroku.com

Goals:
* A Diku-like MUD experience from within the browser.
* Enable Development, and to keep things simple
* Real-time browser OLC and world management.
* Accessible content

Notes on dependencies: 
* Socket.io 1.0 or greater is required.
* Default terminal loads Bootstrap from CDN
* Development aims to keep up with latest node release.

Some things Currently in 0.2.0:
* No command whitelisting (add a command function, and it becomes a in-game command instantly). RockMUD does not rely on parsing commands on a tick.
* Character creation (Races, Classes, Stats, Passwords) and saving as json files (/players).
* Channels
* Uniform way of scripting commands -- with permission checking
* Command aliases defined client side.
* Various 'standard' commands (see: HELP COMMANDS)
* Basic Combat (see: kill <mob name>)
* Inventory
* Ticks
* Dynamic movement directions/options.
* Message Templates
* Skill Example (see: bash)
* Spell Example: (see: cast spark)
* AI (starting)

##Core Modules, found in /src :##
**world.js**
Functions that have game-wide reach. In memory data -- World.races, World.players, World.msgPlayer() are a few examples.

**room.js**
Used to interact with loaded areas found in World.areas[]

**combat.js**
All things combat.

**character.js**
Anything function related to creating or interacting with a real-world player is here.

**dice.js**
Core logic for dice rolls is in its own module. Is attached to world.dice. ex: world.dice.roll(1, 6) or world.dice.roll('1d6').

**ticks.js**
There is no single heartbeat timer. This controls the games timed events -- other than the core combat loop which is in Combat.js

**commands.js, skills.js, spells.js**
All game commands are in found in these three files. Creating the function (test) in Commands.js adds the command (test) to the game.

**/templates/objects**  
JSON templates used to enhance in-game items; and to ensure default values.

* item.json is the default object attached to all 'non-living' objects upon initial load.
* Properties in any passed in objects overwrite those in the template.

**/templates/html**  
HTML templates mainly retrieved to ease complex display. For RockMUD core this means character creation screens.
